# MaxEnt_AndroidMalware_Detection_Model
A Detection Model for Android Malware based on Conditional Maximum Entropy
Abstract:
There is no doubt that malware has become one of the most prevalent issues in the information security sector especially in the mobile devices. One of the mobile device systems that have encountered more malware detection issues than others is the Android OS as it is open source and has a wide range of users and sources for applications. The wide range of applications provided by this operating system has made it possible for the makers of these applications who might also be cyber criminals with malicious intents to hook unnecessary and harmful permissions and functions into their applications that is able to give them access to the sensitive information generated by the users of these devices. Most well reknowned anti-virus companies are already combating this issue using traditional signatures embedded into their detection models but this method has a weakness against code obfuscation.
This project therefore presented a detection system for android malware that employs the use of dynamic analysis and conditional maximum entropy (C.M.E) model to discover and classify dangerous applications on Android devices. The technology monitors app performance in real-time while collecting important events and actions by using dynamic analysis techniques. The method also used machine learning to categorize app behavioral patterns by utilizing the capability of the CME model which uses logistic regression to statistically classify and give the probability of an application being malware or benign using the features extracted from them during the dynamic analysis stage. The system then adapts to new threats and offers proactive malware prevention through continual learning and upgrading thus protecting userâ€™s devices and their data from potential security threats. 
The developed system can detect malicious applications with an accuracy of 99.03% and is able to safeguard android device users from malware.
